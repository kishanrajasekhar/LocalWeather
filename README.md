# LocalWeather

This web app displays the local weather in the user's current location. It shows, the city, current weather condition, and temperature. 
There is also more information like pressure, humidity, and wind speed. There is a different background image for different weather.

I used the google maps api to get the city name from the user's location (latitude and longitude coordinates) and the openweather api to 
get the weather data. This is a freecodecamp project.
